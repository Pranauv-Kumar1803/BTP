        "Name": "WordPress Redux Framework <=4.2.11 - Information Disclosure",
        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "WordPress Redux Framework plugin through 4.2.11 is susceptible to information disclosure. The plugin registers several unique AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users in the includes function in redux-core/class-redux-core.php. These are predictable, given that they are based on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of -redux and an md5 hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of -support. An attacker can potentially employ these AJAX actions to retrieve a list of active plugins and their versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of the site's AUTH_KEY concatenated with the SECURE_AUTH_KEY.",

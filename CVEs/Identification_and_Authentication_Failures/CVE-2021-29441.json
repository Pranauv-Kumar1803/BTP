        "Name": "Nacos <1.4.1 - Authentication Bypass",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "This template only works on Nuclei engine prior to version 2.3.3 and version >= 2.3.5.\n\nIn Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true)\nNacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that\nenables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks.\nThis mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed.\nThis issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server.\n",

        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "WordPress Tutor LMS plugin before 2.0.10 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the reset_key and user_id parameters before outputting then back in attributes. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, which can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. This vulnerability can be used against high-privilege users such as admin.\n",

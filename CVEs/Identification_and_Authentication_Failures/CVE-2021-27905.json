    "Info": {
        "Name": "Apache Solr <=8.8.1 - Server-Side Request Forgery",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Apache Solr versions 8.8.1 and prior contain a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at \"/replication\" under a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a \"masterUrl\" (also \"leaderUrl\" alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the \"shards\" parameter.",

    "Info": {
        "Name": "Sunhillo SureLine <8.7.0.1.1 - Unauthenticated OS Command Injection",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Sunhillo SureLine <8.7.0.1.1 is vulnerable to OS command injection. The /cgi/networkDiag.cgi script directly incorporated user-controllable parameters within a shell command, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resulting command by injecting valid OS command input. The following POST request injects a new command that instructs the server to establish a reverse TCP connection to another system, allowing the establishment of an interactive remote shell session.",

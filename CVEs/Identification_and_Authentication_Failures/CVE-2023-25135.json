    "Info": {
        "Name": "vBulletin <= 5.6.9 - Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "vBulletin before 5.6.9 PL1 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request that triggers deserialization. This occurs because verify_serialized checks that a value is serialized by calling unserialize and then checking for errors.\n",

            "CVSSScore": "9.8"
        }

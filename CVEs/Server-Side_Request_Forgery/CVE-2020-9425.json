        "Name": "rConfig <3.9.4 - Sensitive Information Disclosure",
        "Severity": "high",
        "Description": "rConfig prior to version 3.9.4 is susceptible to sensitive information disclosure. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials via a GET request to settings.php. Because the application does not exit after a redirect is applied, the rest of the page still executes, resulting in the disclosure of cleartext credentials in the response.",

    "ID": "CVE-2019-0193",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "Apache Solr DataImportHandler <8.2.0 - Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "high",
        "Description": "Apache Solr is vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities via the DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from databases and other sources. The module has a feature in which the whole DIH configuration can come from a request's \"dataConfig\" parameter. The debug mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk.\n",

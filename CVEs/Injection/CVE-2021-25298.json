        "Name": "Nagios XI 5.5.6-5.7.5 - Authenticated Remote Command Injection",
        "Severity": "high",
        "Description": "Nagios XI 5.5.6 through 5.7.5 is susceptible to authenticated remote command injection. There is improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request via the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/cloud-vm/cloud-vm.inc.php. This in turn can lead to remote code execution, by which an attacker can execute malware, obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or gain full control over a compromised system without entering necessary credentials.\n",

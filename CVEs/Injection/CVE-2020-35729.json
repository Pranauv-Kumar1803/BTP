    "Info": {
        "Name": "Klog Server <=2.41 - Unauthenticated Command Injection",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Klog Server 2.4.1 and prior is susceptible to an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability. The `authenticate.php` file uses the `user` HTTP POST parameter in a call to the `shell_exec()` PHP function without appropriate input validation, allowing arbitrary command execution as the apache user. The sudo configuration permits the Apache user to execute any command as root without providing a password, resulting in privileged command execution as root.

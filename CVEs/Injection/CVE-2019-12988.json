        "Name": "Citrix SD-WAN Center - Remote Command Injection",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via the addModifyZTDProxy function in NmsController. The function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted value for ztd_password,  thereby potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.\n",

    "ID": "CVE-2019-12987",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "Citrix SD-WAN Center - Remote Command Injection",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via the apply action in StorageMgmtController. The callStoragePerl function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying an array value with crafted values for action, host, path, or type, thereby potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.\n",

        "Name": "WordPress Fusion Builder <3.6.2 - Server-Side Request Forgery",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "WordPress Fusion Builder plugin before 3.6.2 is susceptible to server-side request forgery. The plugin does not validate a parameter in its forms, which can be used to initiate arbitrary HTTP requests. The data returned is then reflected back in the application's response. An attacker can potentially interact with hosts on the server's local network, bypass firewalls, and access control measures.\n",

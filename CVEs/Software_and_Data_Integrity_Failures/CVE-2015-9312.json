The plugin utilizes, on lines 28 and 31 of the file \"includes/nsp_search.php\", several variables from the $_GET scope without sanitation. While WordPress automatically escapes quotes on this scope, the outputs on these lines are outside of quotes, and as such can be utilized to initiate a cross-site scripting attack.\n",

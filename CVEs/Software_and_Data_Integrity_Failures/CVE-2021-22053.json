        "Name": "Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix Dashboard <2.2.10 - Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "high",
        "Description": "Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix Dashboard prior to version 2.2.10 is susceptible to remote code execution. Applications using both `spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard` and `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` expose a way to execute code submitted within the request URI path during the resolution of view templates.  When a request is made at `/hystrix/monitor;[user-provided data]`, the path elements following `hystrix/monitor` are being evaluated as SpringEL expressions, which can lead to code execution.\n",

    "Info": {
        "Name": "Citrix SD-WAN Center - Local File Inclusion",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to local file inclusion via the applianceSettingsFileTransfer function in ApplianceSettingsController. The function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values used to construct a file system path. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted value for filename, filedata, and workspace_id, therefore being able to write files to locations writable by the www-data user and/or to write a crafted PHP file to /home/talariuser/www/app/webroot/files/ to execute arbitrary PHP code.\n",

        "Name": "Revive Adserver 4.2 - Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Revive Adserver 4.2 is susceptible to remote code execution. An attacker can send a crafted payload to the XML-RPC invocation script and trigger the unserialize() call on the \"what\" parameter in the \"openads.spc\" RPC method. This can be exploited to perform various types of attacks, e.g. serialize-related PHP vulnerabilities or PHP object injection. It is possible, although unconfirmed, that the vulnerability has been used by some attackers in order to gain access to some Revive Adserver instances and deliver malware through them to third-party websites.\n",

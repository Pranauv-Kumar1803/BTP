    "ID": "CVE-2018-12613",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "PhpMyAdmin <4.8.2 - Local File Inclusion",
        "Severity": "high",
        "Description": "PhpMyAdmin before version 4.8.2 is susceptible to local file inclusion that allows an attacker to include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).",

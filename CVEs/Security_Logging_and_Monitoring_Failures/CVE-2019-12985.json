        "Name": "Citrix SD-WAN Center - Remote Command Injection",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via the ping function in DiagnosticsController, which does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values used to construct a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted value for ipAddress, pingCount, or packetSize, thereby potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.\n",

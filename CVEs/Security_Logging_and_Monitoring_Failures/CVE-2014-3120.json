    "Info": {
        "Name": "ElasticSearch v1.1.1/1.2 RCE",
        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "The default configuration in Elasticsearch before 1.2 enables dynamic scripting, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary MVEL expressions and Java code via the source parameter to _search. Be aware this only violates the vendor's intended security policy if the user does not run Elasticsearch in its own independent virtual machine.\n",

        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "WordPress Watu Quiz plugin before 3.3.9.1 is susceptible to cross-site scripting. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, such as email, dn, date, and points, before outputting then back in a page. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. This exploit can be used against high-privilege users such as admin.\n",

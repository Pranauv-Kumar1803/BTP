        "Name": "GitLab CE/EE - Hard-Coded Credentials",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "GitLab CE/EE contains a hard-coded credentials vulnerability. A hardcoded password was set for accounts registered using an OmniAuth provider (e.g. OAuth, LDAP, SAML), allowing attackers to potentially take over accounts. This template attempts to passively identify vulnerable versions of GitLab without the need for an exploit by matching unique hashes for the application-<hash>.css file in the header for unauthenticated requests. Positive matches do not guarantee exploitability. Affected versions are 14.7 prior to 14.7.7, 14.8 prior to 14.8.5, and 14.9 prior to 14.9.2.",

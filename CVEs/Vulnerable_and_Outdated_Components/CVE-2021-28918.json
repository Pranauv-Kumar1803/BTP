        "Name": "Netmask NPM Package - Server-Side Request Forgery",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Netmask NPM Package is susceptible to server-side request forgery because of improper input validation of octal strings in netmask npm package. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, remote file inclusion, and local file inclusion attacks on many of the dependent packages. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass packages relying on netmask to filter IPs and reach critical VPN or LAN hosts.",

        "Name": "WordPress Yuzo <5.12.94 - Cross-Site Scripting",
        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "WordPress Yuzo Related Posts plugin before 5.12.94 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting\nbecause it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the\nrequest comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the\nrequest is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can consequently inject\na payload into the plugin settings, such as the\nyuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.\n",

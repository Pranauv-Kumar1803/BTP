        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "KubeView through 0.1.31 is susceptible to information disclosure. An attacker can obtain control of a Kubernetes cluster because api/scrape/kube-system does not require authentication and retrieves certificate files that can be used for authentication as kube-admin. An attacker can thereby possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.\n",

        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5 has HTML autoescaping  disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allows a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since run with \"DEBUG = True\" is not on by default (which is what makes the page visible).\n",

    "ID": "CVE-2021-41192",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "Redash Setup Configuration - Default Secrets Disclosure",
        "Severity": "medium",
        "Description": "Redash Setup Configuration is vulnerable to default secrets disclosure (Insecure Default Initialization of Resource). If an admin sets up Redash versions <=10.0 and prior without explicitly specifying the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` or `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, a default value is used for both that is the same across all installations. In such cases, the instance is vulnerable to attackers being able to forge sessions using the known default value.",

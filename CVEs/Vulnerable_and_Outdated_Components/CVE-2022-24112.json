    "ID": "CVE-2022-24112",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "Apache APISIX - Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.",

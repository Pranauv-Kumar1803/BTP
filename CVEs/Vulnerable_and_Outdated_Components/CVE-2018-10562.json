    "ID": "CVE-2018-10562",
    "Info": {
        "Name": "Dasan GPON Devices - Remote Code Execution",
        "Severity": "critical",
        "Description": "Dasan GPON home routers are susceptible to command injection which can occur via the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form URI. Because the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user when the user revisits /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output.",

### Web Vulnerability Scanning - B24NT03

#### BTP Project - IIIT Sricity

Hi there!

Our main aim is to combine as many open source tools as possible and create a tool which is user friendly in terms of the usage as well as the results!

This is the main codebase for most of the scanners and tools that we have integrated together to scan various websites for vulnerabilities.

We have various folders - for the results and outputs of the tools' scanning!
